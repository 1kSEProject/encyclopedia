							<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
						</header>
							<p>The Impact transformed Earth from a veritable eden into an apocalyptic wasteland. The core froze over, and the atmosphere was nearly destroyed. Luckily the planet is slowly recovering. The atmosphere still exists in some areas as small pockets (or bubbles) where travel without a suit is possible. The pockets are kept alive by extreme weather such as dust storms, hurricanes, fire storms, and blizzards. Peoples from all over the Solar System travel to Earth to get their hands on ancient technology from the Golden Age of humanity. Archaeologists, Scrappers, Crime Syndicates, Biologists, and countless others duke it out over the dwindling resources for a chance at power in the eternal battle that has come to be known as the <i>Magefray</i>.</p>

							<h3>AWAKENING</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Among the many subsects of the human species we know today only three existed as proto-cultures on Earth around 850TE*; they were Earthling, Kymera, and Electrist. Earthlings fought violently over their genome and thus called themselves Blud. Kymera often delved into the forbidden magics of bioengineering, modifying their DNA to mimic insects and other animals. Electrists shed their humanity entirely. They were the first to abandon their physical forms and join the WWW. Immortality gave them power. Secrecy gave them the name Null.</p>
						<p>A sudden leap in technology brought on by a star shower in the year 914TE is recorded in many SMS and blog entries of the time. Whether this is a metaphor for enlightenment or a legitimate extraterrestrial claim has yet to be discovered and is a hot topic of debate among many Kuipers. However most everyone agrees that the result of this shower and the subsequent spike in scientific advancement on Earth was the tipping point that led to Humanity’s downfall.</p>
						<p>The first few who experimented with genetic modification and cybernetic-surgeries were shunned upon by the Blud. At the time Blud was the ruling class, a collection of royal families and noblemen who passed on their corporations by birthright. These Corps lived off the backs of the people, sucking them dry with debt and interest fees. For a thousand years the people had been under their control; subjugated and stripped of their freedom. The star shower signalled a revolution.</p>
						<p>In 700 T.E. New technologies began to emerge at a rapid pace. Mothers could now choose not only the sex of their child at conception, but also their ethnicity and IQ. War veterans who lost a leg in battle could find their appendage surgically replaced with a gasoline model capable of incredible speed and maneuverability. A man of modest means living in a city could find within his budget the opportunity to have his bone density lowered and dragonfly wings implanted to his shoulder blades giving him the ability to fly for a faster commute. The sheer variety of technological application was at first wondrous, but soon it created friction. Local communities formed around different inventions. Past wounds began to open. The Kymera, who worshipped Nature, sought to demolish buildings and engineer pavement eating plants to rip up the metal cities and concrete suburban wastelands that were killing the planet. The Blud, who worshipped the past, kept their genepool pure and vowed to destroy all who tained theirs with science. The Null, who worshipped themselves, left the material realm and then sought to conquer it with mechanical creatures of war. These three proto-races of Humanity warred endlessly on the local level like a virus eating its host from within. By 100 T.E. The great nation-states who had kept the peace for thousands of years had lost all control.</p>
						<header>
							<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
						</header>
						<p>At the height of Earth’s socio-political chaos a summit was held at the U.N. North Atlantic Headquarters** to discuss a peace treaty. The leaders of all major nations attended, but the spotlight was given to three war leaders who had emerged in the struggles between the Blud, Kymera, and Null. It was thought that if these leaders could come to an accord the world might be restored to a state of order. Unfortunately the U.N. hadn’t considered the depth of enmity these three leaders held toward each other, nor the foul lengths they would go to fulfill their ideals.</p>
						<p>The Children Bacal led the Kymera Liberation Front. Their leader, a Centaur chieftain by the name of Fiorn, handled military strategy and political negotiation. He was often accompanied by his eldest sister Mona, ruler of Haven*** and commander of the skyforces, and his brothers Pietre and Hynor-Jecht leaders of the sea and ground forces respectively. The Children Bacal varied wildly in appearance and temperament but are thought to be the origin of the Four Tribes of modern-day Venus.</p>
						<p>The death of York VIII President of the Board left a vacancy in the Blud oligarchy that needed to be filled. Amid fears of rebellion and rumors of a usurper among the Members of the Board, the Supreme-CEOs quickly appointed Chase York IX, a boy of 14,  to rule under the supervision of his mother Morgan of house Pierpont. The sudden accrual of power to someone so young drove York IX mad. He was determined to end the war as quickly as possible, often using nuclear and biochemical weapons against Kymera and Null strongholds without heart to the thousands of innocents who were killed in the crossfire. Many say York IX delighted in death and would stroll through the wreckage of towns he had laid waste. Still darker are the rumors of his bloodbaths, where he would sacrifice servants to wash in.</p>
						<p>Most reports surrounding the leader of Null are unsubstantiated. Appearances of a hooded figure wearing a white raven mask are widely referenced, although it is thought these masks were heavily circulated and easily acquirable (which may well have been the point). The major Null military outposts centered around server farms and vehicle manufacturing plants. This, combined with their use of hacked-together vehicle and weapons parts in battle, point to a curious explanation of Null culture. It is very possible the process of digitizing the soul was discovered early on and a mass exodus occurred. Warriors sacrificed their physical bodies to take on powerful machines for the war effort. The mythos surrounding the true leader of the mysterious Null are even more nebulous. The leader went by the pronoun “they” and it is said they were immortal, speaking with the voice of a thousand screaming souls.</p>
						<p>What was said at the summit between these three leaders is unknown, but the outcome was Death. A massive stray asteroid from the Belt entered the atmosphere and landed directly on top of the UN North Pacific Headquarters vaporizing all who attended. The resulting global calamity is now known as the Impact. Whether this was an accident or an intentional plot by one of the three war leaders is pending investigation.</p>
